    "preamble": "PreambleThe General Conference of the International Labour Organization,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the\n            International Labour Office, and having met in its 103rd Session\n            on 28 May 2014, andRecognizing that the prohibition of forced or compulsory labour\n            forms part of the body of fundamental rights, and that forced\n            or compulsory labour violates the human rights and dignity of\n            millions of women and men, girls and boys, contributes to the\n            perpetuation of poverty and stands in the way of the achievement\n            of decent work for all, andRecognizing the vital role played by the Forced Labour Convention,\n            1930 (No. 29), hereinafter referred to as “the Convention”, and\n            the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105), in\n            combating all forms of forced or compulsory labour, but that gaps\n            in their implementation call for additional measures, andRecalling that the definition of forced or compulsory labour under\n            Article 2 of the Convention covers forced or compulsory labour\n            in all its forms and manifestations and is applicable to all human\n            beings without distinction, andEmphasizing the urgency of eliminating forced and compulsory labour\n            in all its forms and manifestations, andRecalling the obligation of Members that have ratified the Convention\n            to make forced or compulsory labour punishable as a penal\n            offence, and to ensure that the penalties imposed by law are really\n            adequate and are strictly enforced, andNoting that the transitional period provided for in the Convention has\n            expired, and the provisions of Article 1, paragraphs 2 and 3, and\n            Articles 3 to 24 are no longer applicable, andRecognizing that the context and forms of forced or compulsory\n            labour have changed and trafficking in persons for the purposes\n            of forced or compulsory labour, which may involve sexual\n            exploitation, is the subject of growing international concern and\n            requires urgent action for its effective elimination, andNoting that there is an increased number of workers who are in forced\n            or compulsory labour in the private economy, that certain sectors\n            of the economy are particularly vulnerable, and that certain\n            groups of workers have a higher risk of becoming victims of\n            forced or compulsory labour, especially migrants, andNoting that the effective and sustained suppression of forced or\n            compulsory labour contributes to ensuring fair competition\n            among employers as well as protection for workers, andRecalling the relevant international labour standards, including, in\n            particular, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right\n            to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), the Right to Organise\n            and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), the Equal\n            Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100),

Convention, 1999 (No. 182), the Migration for\n            Employment Convention (Revised), 1949 (No. 97), the Migrant\n            Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (No. 143),\n            the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189), the Private\n            Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 (No. 181), the Labour\n            Inspection Convention, 1947 (No. 81), the Labour Inspection\n            (Agriculture) Convention, 1969 (No. 129), as well as the ILO\n            Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\n            (1998), and the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair\n            Globalization (2008), andNoting other relevant international instruments, in particular the\n            Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International\n            Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the International\n            Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), the\n            Slavery Convention (1926), the Supplementary Convention on the\n            Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices\n            Similar to Slavery (1956), the United Nations Convention against\n            Transnational Organized Crime (2000), the Protocol to Prevent,\n            Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and\n            Children (2000), the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants\n            by Land, Sea and Air (2000), the International Convention on the\n            Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members\n            of Their Families (1990), the Convention against Torture and\n            Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\n            (1984), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\n            Discrimination against Women (1979), and the Convention on the\n            Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals to address\n            gaps in implementation of the Convention, and reaffirmed\n            that measures of prevention, protection, and remedies, such as\n            compensation and rehabilitation, are necessary to achieve the\n            effective and sustained suppression of forced or compulsory\n            labour, pursuant to the fourth item on the agenda of the session,\n            andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of a\n            Protocol to the Convention;adopts this eleventh day of June two thousand and fourteen the following\n            Protocol, which may be cited as the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour\n            Convention, 1930.",

    "preamble": "PreambleThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Sixtieth Session on 4 June 1975, andRecognising that the importance of rural workers in the world makes it urgent to associate them with economic and social development action if their conditions of work and life are to be permanently and effectively improved, andNoting that in many countries of the world and particularly in developing countries there is massive under-utilisation of land and labour and that this makes it imperative for rural workers to be given every encouragement to develop free and viable organisations capable of protecting and furthering the interests of their members and ensuring their effective contribution to economic and social development, andConsidering that such organisations can and should contribute to the alleviation of the persistent scarcity of food products in various regions of the world, andRecognising that land reform is in many developing countries an essential factor in the improvement of the conditions of work and life of rural workers and that organisations of such workers should accordingly co-operate and participate actively in the implementation of such reform, andRecalling the terms of existing international labour Conventions and Recommendations--in particular the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, 1921, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948, and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949--which affirm the right of all workers, including rural workers, to establish free and independent organisations, and the provisions of numerous international labour Conventions and Recommendations applicable to rural workers which call for the participation, inter alia, of workers' organisations in their implementation, andNoting the joint concern of the United Nations and the specialised agencies, in particular the International Labour Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, with land reform and rural development, andNoting that the following standards have been framed in co-operation with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and that, with a view to avoiding duplication, there will be continuing co-operation with that Organisation and with the United Nations in promoting and securing the application of these standards, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to organisations of rural workers and their role in economic and social development, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-third day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five the following Convention, which may be cited as the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention, 1975:",

    "preamble": "PreambleThe General Conference of the International Labour Organization,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the\n            International Labour Office, and having met in its 103rd Session\n            on 28 May 2014, andRecognizing that the prohibition of forced or compulsory labour\n            forms part of the body of fundamental rights, and that forced\n            or compulsory labour violates the human rights and dignity of\n            millions of women and men, girls and boys, contributes to the\n            perpetuation of poverty and stands in the way of the achievement\n            of decent work for all, andRecognizing the vital role played by the Forced Labour Convention,\n            1930 (No. 29), hereinafter referred to as “the Convention”, and\n            the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105), in\n            combating all forms of forced or compulsory labour, but that gaps\n            in their implementation call for additional measures, andRecalling that the definition of forced or compulsory labour under\n            Article 2 of the Convention covers forced or compulsory labour\n            in all its forms and manifestations and is applicable to all human\n            beings without distinction, andEmphasizing the urgency of eliminating forced and compulsory labour\n            in all its forms and manifestations, andRecalling the obligation of Members that have ratified the Convention\n            to make forced or compulsory labour punishable as a penal\n            offence, and to ensure that the penalties imposed by law are really\n            adequate and are strictly enforced, andNoting that the transitional period provided for in the Convention has\n            expired, and the provisions of Article 1, paragraphs 2 and 3, and\n            Articles 3 to 24 are no longer applicable, andRecognizing that the context and forms of forced or compulsory\n            labour have changed and trafficking in persons for the purposes\n            of forced or compulsory labour, which may involve sexual\n            exploitation, is the subject of growing international concern and\n            requires urgent action for its effective elimination, andNoting that there is an increased number of workers who are in forced\n            or compulsory labour in the private economy, that certain sectors\n            of the economy are particularly vulnerable, and that certain\n            groups of workers have a higher risk of becoming victims of\n            forced or compulsory labour, especially migrants, andNoting that the effective and sustained suppression of forced or\n            compulsory labour contributes to ensuring fair competition\n            among employers as well as protection for workers, andRecalling the relevant international labour standards, including, in\n            particular, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right\n            to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), the Right to Organise\n            and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), the Equal\n            Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100), the Discrimination\n            (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111), the\n            Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), the Worst Forms\n            of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182), the Migration for\n            Employment Convention (Revised), 1949 (No. 97), the Migrant\n            Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (No. 143),\n            the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189), the Private\n            Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 (No. 181), the Labour\n            Inspection Convention, 1947 (No. 81), the Labour Inspection\n            (Agriculture) Convention, 1969 (No. 129), as well as the ILO\n            Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\n            (1998), and the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair\n            Globalization (2008), andNoting other relevant international instruments, in particular the\n            Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International\n            Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the International\n            Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), the\n            Slavery Convention (1926), the Supplementary Convention on the\n            Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices\n            Similar to Slavery (1956), the United Nations Convention against\n            Transnational Organized Crime (2000), the Protocol to Prevent,\n            Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and\n            Children (2000), the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants\n            by Land, Sea and Air (2000), the International Convention on the\n            Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members\n            of Their Families (1990), the Convention against Torture and\n            Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\n            (1984), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\n            Discrimination against Women (1979), and the Convention on the\n            Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals to address\n            gaps in implementation of the Convention, and reaffirmed\n            that measures of prevention, protection, and remedies, such as\n            compensation and rehabilitation, are necessary to achieve the\n            effective and sustained suppression of forced or compulsory\n            labour, pursuant to the fourth item on the agenda of the session,\n            andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of a\n            Protocol to the Convention;adopts this eleventh day of June two thousand and fourteen the following\n            Protocol, which may be cited as the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour\n            Convention, 1930.",

    "preamble": "PreambleThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Forty-ninth Session on 2 June 1965, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to medical examination of young persons for fitness for employment underground in mines, which is included in the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andNoting that the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Industry) Convention, 1946, which is applicable to mines, provides that children and young persons under 18 years of age shall not be admitted to employment by an industrial undertaking unless they have been found fit for the work on which they are to be employed by a thorough medical examination, that the continued employment of a child or young person under 18 years of age shall be subject to the repetition of a medical examination at intervals of not more than one year, and that national laws or regulations shall make provision concerning additional re-examinations, andNoting that the Convention further provides that in occupations which involve high health risks medical examination and re-examinations for fitness for employment shall be required until at least the age of 21 years, and that national laws or regulations shall either specify or empower an appropriate authority to specify the occupations or categories of occupations to which this requirement applies, andConsidering that, in view of the health risks inherent in employment underground in mines, international standards requiring medical examination and periodic re-examination for fitness for employment underground in mines until the age of 21 years, and specifying the nature of these examinations, are desirable, andHaving determined that these standards shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-third day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and sixty-five the following Convention, which may be cited as the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Underground Work) Convention, 1965:",

The medical care referred to in Article 8 of the Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969, should include--(a) the supply of medical aids, such as eyeglasses; and(b) services for convalescents.4. The right to the medical care referred to in Article 8 of the Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969, should not be made subject to a qualifying period.5.

    "preamble": "PreambleThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Seventy-fifth Session on 1 June 1988, andEmphasising the importance of work and productive employment in any society not only because of the resources which they create for the community, but also because of the income which they bring to workers, the social role which they confer and the feeling of self-esteem which workers derive from them, andRecalling the existing international standards in the field of employment and unemployment protection (the Unemployment Provision Convention and Recommendation, 1934, the Unemployment (Young Persons) Recommendation, 1935, the Income Security Recommendation, 1944, the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952, the Employment Policy Convention and Recommendation, 1964, the Human Resources Development Convention and Recommendation, 1975, the Labour Administration Convention and Recommendation, 1978, and the Employment Policy (Supplementary Provisions) Recommendation, 1984), andConsidering the widespread unemployment and underemployment affecting various countries throughout the world at all stages of development and in particular the problems of young people, many of whom are seeking their first employment, andConsidering that, since the adoption of the international instruments concerning protection against unemployment referred to above, there have been important new developments in the law and practice of many Members necessitating the revision of existing standards, in particular the Unemployment Provision Convention, 1934, and the adoption of new international standards concerning the promotion of full, productive and freely chosen employment by all appropriate means, including social security, andNoting that the provisions concerning unemployment benefit in the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952, lay down a level of protection that has now been surpassed by most of the existing compensation schemes in the industrialised countries and, unlike standards concerning other benefits, have not been followed by higher standards, but that the standards in question can still constitute a target for developing countries that are in a position to set up an unemployment compensation scheme, andRecognising that policies leading to stable, sustained, non-inflationary economic growth and a flexible response to change, as well as to creation and promotion of all forms of productive and freely chosen employment including small undertakings, co-operatives, self-employment and local initiatives for employment, even through the re-distribution of resources currently devoted to the financing of purely assistance-oriented activities towards activities which promote employment especially vocational guidance, training and rehabilitation, offer the best protection against the adverse effects of involuntary unemployment, but that involuntary unemployment nevertheless exists and that it is therefore important to ensure that social security systems should provide employment assistance and economic support to those who are involuntarily unemployed, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to employment promotion and social security which is the fifth item on the agenda of the session with a view, in particular, to revising the Unemployment Provision Convention, 1934, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-first day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight the following Convention, which may be cited as the Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988:",
